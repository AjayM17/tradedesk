📘 Trading Engine – V1

Tagline:

No Rule, No Trade

Trading Engine is a rule-based positional trading app focused on capital protection, discipline, and consistency.
V1 is intentionally minimal and opinionated — built for real trading, not dashboards or vanity metrics.

🎯 Purpose of V1

V1 exists to answer one core question:

Can a trader strictly follow predefined rules with the help of software?

This version prioritizes:

Rule enforcement over analytics

Correctness over visual complexity

Discipline over flexibility

🧠 Trading Philosophy

Rules are non-negotiable

Capital protection comes first

Decisions are made only at valid checkpoints

If rules are not met → No Trade

These are postponed to future versions based on real usage, not assumptions.

🧱 Architecture Highlights

Designed to scale without refactoring core logic

🔐 Authentication & Data

🧠 Final Note

A trading app doesn’t need to look exciting.
It needs to stop you from making mistakes.

Trading Engine V1 is built with that belief.

No Rule. No Trade.
